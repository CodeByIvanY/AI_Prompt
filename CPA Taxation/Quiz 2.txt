Question 1 
Hansalle Inc. (HI) is an eligible small Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) and its taxation year end is December 31. Taxes payable for HI in 2023 and 2024 totalled $12,000 and $10,000, respectively, and HI’s estimated taxes payable for 2025 equal $13,000.
Which one of the following is the minimum required amount for HI’s third quarterly instalment payment due for the 2025 taxation year?
a) $2,000
b) $2,333
c) $2,500
d) $3,250
Feedback
Option b) is correct. It was determined as follows:
The least of: 
i) ¼ of estimated net tax owing for 2025 = $13,000 / 4 = $3,250
ii) ¼ of net tax owing for 2024 = $10,000 / 4 = $2,500
iii) First instalment: ¼ of net tax owing for 2023 = $12,000 / 4 = $3,000
Last three instalments: net tax owing for 2024 – first instalment = $10,000 – $3,000 = $7,000 remainder
⅓ of remainder = $7,000 / 3 = $2,333
This amount is less than one-fourth of current estimated tax payable of $3,250 ($13,000 / 4) and one-fourth of the 2024 tax payable of $2,500 ($10,000 / 4).
Question 2 
Today is August 1, 2024, and Jalbert Inc., a Canadian-controlled private corporation, received a notice of assessment (NOA) relating to its November 30, 2023, year-end corporate income tax return. The NOA was dated July 27, 2024. The CFO of Jalbert disagrees with the Canada Revenue Agency’s (CRA’s) decision to disallow certain expenses and wants to file a notice of objection (NOO).
Which one of the following dates is the last day on which Jalbert can file an NOO?
a) October 25, 2024
b) October 30, 2024
c) November 30, 2024
d) May 31, 2025
Feedback
Option a) is correct. For corporations, an NOO must be filed within 90 days of the mailing date of the NOA.
Question 3 
Graydon Snider, who is not self-employed, filed his 2023 personal income tax return on June 14, 2024. The correct amount of tax owing was $70,000 and Graydon paid the amount in full upon filing. He was assessed a penalty last year for the late filing of his 2022 tax return. Assume the CRA prescribed rate is 5%.
How much interest and penalties could be assessed for Graydon’s 2023 tax return?
a) $5,028
b) $8,180
c) $8,400
d) $9,275
Feedback
Option d) is correct. The tax payment was due on April 30, 2024. The penalty calculation for a repeated offence is 10% of the tax that was unpaid at the filing deadline plus 2% for each complete month that the unpaid tax is owing (up to a maximum of 20 months). The filing deadline for individuals who are not self-employed is April 30. April 30 to June 14 represents one complete month. Interest is calculated at 9% (4% + 5% prescribed rate) and will also apply on unpaid amounts owing. Therefore, the interest and penalty is calculated as follows:
Repeated failure to file penalty: [10% + (2% × 1 month)] × $70,000 8,400
Interest: {($70,000 + 8,400) × [1 + (0.09 / 365)]^45} – $78,400 875
Total interest and penalty $9,275
Question 4 
The controller for Coastal Pools Inc. is calculating taxable income for the year ended 2024.
Applicable information is as follows:
Net income for tax purposes is $191,500.
During 2024, the company sold all of its shares in Breckenridge Ltd. for $27,000. The original cost of the shares was $17,300. No other capital transactions occurred.
Charitable donations made to the Canadian Cancer Society totalled $525.
The company has a capital loss carryforward of $11,750 from the previous year when it sold shares in Harrison Ltd.
How much is taxable income for 2024?
a) $179,225
b) $185,100
c) $186,125
d) $186,650
Feedback
Option c) is correct. This was determined as follows:
Net income for tax purposes $191,500 
Charitable donations (525)
Net capital loss carryforward deducted (4,850)
Taxable income $186,125 
Taxable capital gains included in net income were $4,850 [($27,000 – 17,300) × ½ = $4,850]. The net capital loss carryover is $11,750 × ½ = $5,875. The maximum Division C deduction that may be claimed for the net capital loss is the lesser of the taxable capital gain included in income of $4,850 and the net capital loss carryover of $5,875.
Question 5 
Norales Inc. sold a property in January of 2024 that was excess to its needs. Details are as follows:
Land
Building
Selling price
$ 234,000 
$ 236,000 
Original cost
196,000 
319,000 
Undepreciated capital cost
261,000 
Which one of the following describes the tax consequences of the sale of the property?
a) Allowable capital loss of $22,500; terminal loss of $25,000
b) Terminal loss of $6,000
c) Taxable capital gain of $6,500
d) Taxable capital gain of $19,000; terminal loss of $25,000
Feedback
Option c) is correct. There is a capital gain on the land of ($234,000 – $196,000) = $38,000 and a terminal loss on the building of $261,000 – $236,000 = $25,000. Proceeds are reallocated with the end result being that the capital gain on the land is reduced by the terminal loss on the building, resulting in a taxable capital gain of $6,500. ($38,000 – $25,000) × ½ = $6,500.
Question 6 
Martha runs a small business in Markham, Ontario. In March of 2024, Martha sold her existing land and building used for the business and acquired a new property for the same purpose. The proceeds on the sale of the land and building were allocated $324,000 to the land and $486,000 to the building. The original cost of the land and building was $206,000 and $454,000, respectively. The building had an undepreciated capital cost (UCC) of $323,000. Martha immediately moved into her newly acquired property. The $860,000 purchase price was allocated $360,000 to the land and $500,000 to the building. Martha wishes to minimize the impact of these transactions on her income to the extent possible.
Which one of the following lists the correct amounts for the adjusted costs bases (ACBs) of the new land and building, and the UCC of the new building?
a) ACB of land — $206,000; ACB of building — $454,000; UCC of building — $323,000
b) ACB of land — $242,000; ACB of building — $468,000; UCC of building — $337,000
c) ACB of land — $242,000; ACB of building — $468,000; UCC of building — $369,000
d) ACB of land — $360,000; ACB of building — $500,000; UCC of building — $500,000
Feedback
Option b) is correct. The capital gain on the land is $324,000 – $206,000 = $118,000, and the capital gain on the building is $486,000 – $454,000 = $32,000. The cost of the new land is $360,000, and the cost of the new building is $500,000. In both cases, the total proceeds have been reinvested so the full amounts of the capital gains can be deferred. This will result in ACBs for the land and building as follows: Land: $360,000 – $118,000 = $242,000; Building: $500,000 – $32,000 = $468,000. The full amount of the recapture of $454,000 – $323,000 = $131,000 may also be deferred because an amount in excess of the original cost of the building of $454,000 has been reinvested. UCC after deferred recapture is $468,000 – $131,000 = $337,000.
Question 7 
In 2023, Natasha sold a rare painting she had inherited from her grandmother. The selling price was $375,000, and the fair value of the painting at the time Natasha inherited it was $200,000, resulting in a capital gain of $175,000. At the time of sale, she received a cash payment of $56,250. The remaining amount owing is due as follows: 2024 — $159,375; 2025 — $159,375. Natasha claimed the maximum capital gains reserve possible in 2023 and she intends to do the same in 2024.
How much capital gain will Natasha be subject to tax on in 2024?
a) $35,000
b) $43,750
c) $65,625
d) $74,375
Feedback
Option c) is correct. The 2023 reserve is the lesser of:
($159,375 + $159,375) / $375,000 × $175,000 = $148,750
$175,000 × 4/5 = $140,000
Reserve that may be claimed in 2024 is the lesser of:
$159,375 / $375,000 × $175,000 = $74,375
$175,000 × 3/5 = $105,000
2023 reserve $140,000 less 2024 reserve $74,375 = $65,625 capital gain subject to tax in 2024.

Question 10 
Richard is the sole shareholder of Ringo Inc., a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC) that manufactures drum sets. It was incorporated in 2008 and has qualified for the small business deduction every year since then. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, Ringo had taxable capital of $15,000,000 and $16,500,000, respectively. Ringo’s federal abatement percentage was 90% in each of those years.

a) $418,750
b) $437,500
c) $439,375
d) $456,250
Feedback
Option d) is correct. It was determined as follows:
Taxable capital employed in Canada in 2023: $15,000,000 × 90% = $13,500,000
Reduction in business limit: {[0.225% × ($13,500,000 – $10,000,000)] / 90,000} × $500,000 = $43,750
Reduced business limit: $500,000 – $43,750 = $456,250
Question 11 
Net income for tax purposes for Pill Inc. for 2024 has been correctly calculated as $542,000. Pill is associated with another corporation, and as a result Pill has been allocated 80% of the business limit for the year. Pill received dividends of $150,000 from taxable Canadian corporations in the year. Pill also earned rental income of $24,000 and realized a taxable capital gain of $10,000 in the year. Pill’s and the associated corporation’s adjusted aggregate investment income (AAII) in 2023 and 2024 was less than $50,000. The two corporations’ combined taxable capital employed in Canada (TCEC) in 2023 was less than $10,000,000.

Question 14 
Greg and Patricia are filing for divorce. They are willing to cooperate in finalizing their written separation agreement to minimize the immediate tax impact of splitting their marital assets. As they plan on keeping the assets for the long term and expect to be in similar tax brackets in the foreseeable future, they are not too concerned about consequences of future dispositions. They have the following assets they need to split:
Fair market value (FMV) Adjusted cost base (ACB) Ownership
Family home $850,000 $500,000 50-50
Rental property $400,000 $300,000 50-50
Public company shares $28,000 $42,000 Patricia
They have agreed that Greg will transfer his ownership portion of the family home, their principal residence, to Patricia. Patricia will transfer her ownership portion of the rental property, as well as the public company shares that she owns, to Greg. Patricia has also disposed of other shares this year and has a taxable capital gain of $10,000 to report. 
Which one of the following statements is true?
a) Greg should not elect out of ITA 73(1) for his transfer of the family home.
b) Patricia should allow for automatic transfer under ITA 73(1) for the rental property.
c) Patricia should not elect out of ITA 73(1) for her transfer of the public company shares, as this will trigger a loss, which will be denied.
d) Patricia should elect out of ITA 73(1) for her transfer of the public company shares so that future dividends received will not attribute back to her.
Feedback
Option b) is correct. This statement is true. If Patricia elects out of ITA 73(1), it will result in immediate taxable capital gain on which she will have to pay taxes. The principal residence exemption cannot be used on the rental property. Therefore, to avoid immediate tax consequence, Patricia should allow for automatic transfer under ITA 73(1).
Question 15 
On February 1, 2024, Lanni gifted shares of Marchant Inc., a Canadian public company, to her 15-year-old daughter, MacKenzie. At that time, the fair market value of the shares was $33,000 and the adjusted cost base of the shares was $40,000. During the year, the shares paid dividends of $1,000. MacKenzie sold the shares to an unrelated individual at the end of 2024 for $49,000.
Which one of the following is true?
a) Lanni will realize an allowable capital loss of $3,500 that she can claim against taxable capital gains realized in the year, if any. She will also include dividends of $1,380 in her income. MacKenzie will include an $8,000 taxable capital gain in her income.

Feedback
Option a) is correct. Lanni's allowable capital loss is [($33,000 – $40,000) × ½]. Lanni's daughter is not 18 in the year and the shares were gifted to her; therefore, attribution applies and the dividend is included in Lanni's income. The capital gain of [($49,000 – $33,000) × ½] on subsequent sale is taxed in MacKenzie's hands. Capital gains are not attributed on sales and transfers to non-arm's length minors.
